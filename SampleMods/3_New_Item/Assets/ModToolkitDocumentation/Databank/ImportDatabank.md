**Databank**
______________________________________________________________________________________________

To use the game asset databank in your project you have to download the databank on the official game website
and place it in a directory named Databank in the Assets folder of your mod project (for example if your mod is located in
C:/EOEModProjects/MyModSample the Databank full path should be C:/EOEModProjects/MyModSample/Assets/Databank/modkit_databank)

Just click on the import button of the Databank Importer window and it should create prefabs with all the databank assets,
a dependency to the databank mod file will automatically be added to your workshop entry when uploading it to the Steam Workshop
